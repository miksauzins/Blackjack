To create the game of Blackjack, what objects do I need?

- Player object
- Dealer object
- Person object (an object that carries data about the hand of the person - dealer or player)
- Hand object

- Deck object, which consists of
-- Cards, which consist of :
  -- A value from 1-10;
  -- A symbol (Hearts/Spades/Diamonds/Clubs)

- Create a deck which consists of 52 cards, each a unique combination of value and symbol.
- I need to be able to add and remove cards from deck.
- Where do the used cards go?  

!! During the creation of this project, I drew inspiration from other peoples' blackjack implementations.
